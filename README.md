# AI-Powered Drone Technology for National Defense: A Case Study on Shield AI

##Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Shield AI

* Incorporation: Founded in 2015

* Founder: Brandon Tseng (SEAL Team 5 and SEAL Team 7), Ryan Tseng, and Andrew Reiter.

* Company Origin: Brandon was inspired by the need for autonomous systems that provide situational awareness through autonomous platforms that would provide enhanced safety in kinetic, high-risk environments. This idea was spurred after a mission in Afghanistan resulted in high US casualties in the Uruzgan province due to poor reconnaissance of a hostile building.

* Initial Funding: Angel investors from family and friends to begin operations with $100,000.00 seed funding.

* How much funding have they received?
    - 2021: Received a $7.2 million contract from the US Air Force.
    - 2023: Raised $200 million at a $2.7 billion valuation.
    - 2024: The United States Coast Guard awarded a contract worth up to $198.1 million.
	
## Business Activities

* The Problem: Shield AI’s founders recognized that "on-ground" situational awareness is hard to attain in an active warzone. The company's flagship technologies consisted of a UAV quadcopter named Nova, a fully autonomous platform that works in a contested communications environment where GPS and degraded (signal jamming) communication environments exist through its AI platform called Hivemind. This platform and AI capability provided enhanced reconnaissance in urban environments, especially when US service members were entering a fortified building. The UAV could be deployed into the building and identify enemy combatants before service members even entered the building.

* Customer: The primary customers of this technology are far-reaching. Though initially targeted to support the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), Federal and State agencies have seen the utility of this platform to de-escalate domestic issues, as well as it being deployed in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) after natural catastrophes.

* Market Potential: According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the market was valued at approximately $14.14 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $47.16 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.15% during the forecast period (Source: https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/military-drone-market-102181).

Similarly, Grand View Research estimates the market size at $36.14 billion in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 13.8% from 2024 to 2030 (Source: https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/military-drone-market-report).

These figures highlight the growing market of UAV companies like Shield AI that specialize in AI-driven capabilities for national defense.

* Unfair Advantage: Shield AI was able to capitalize on Brandon Tseng's military experience and political connections within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) as a prior Navy SEAL and combat veteran. Brandon's strategic and tactical experience provided realistic, operational knowledge that spurred the development of Shield AI’s technology. Though experience is not an "unfair advantage," the fact that Brandon is a Naval Combat Veteran lends credibility to decision-makers within DoD compared to a similar company that may not have military experience with equal or even better technology.

* Current Technology: Shield AI's flagship technology is the AI Pilot, Hivemind, that enables autonomous operations without GPS or communication (contested communication). They couple this AI piloting capability with enhanced computer vision that can interpret and navigate complex environments while it maps and identifies critical targeting information to service members in the area. This is achieved by using Size Weight and Power (SWaP) micro components such as companion computers that run edge computing AI/ML algorithms parallel to the UAV flight system. Shield AI's platforms can take off and land vertically (VTOL), which enables service members to launch these UAVs from any environment they are in. The system is further enhanced by the use of integrating various sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, altimeters, and system feedback monitors that provide the Hivemind critical, real-time telemetry data through its autonomous operation.

## Landscape

* Operational Field: Shield AI specializes in defense and autonomous robotic platforms.

* 5/10 Year Trends and Innovation: AI has significantly enhanced autonomous navigation, target recognition, and "on-platform" decision-making in unmanned technology. Swarm technology has also become a technological capability by providing multiple unmanned platforms to operate collaboratively during missions to extend communication, vision and recognition, and platform resilience. There has been a significant shift in modern warfare using unmanned platforms, such that a new business vertical has been developed providing counter UAV/UAS capabilities. As with any technology, especially one developed for operational military missions and counter missions, advancements in UAV stealth and enhanced extended endurance (flight time) expand the combatant commander's operational "bubble" with UAV/UAS flying farther, weighing less, costing less, using Commercial/Government Off the Shelf (COTS/GOTS), and the integration of line-of-sight communication as well as cellular integration such as 5G.

* Competitors:
	- Anduril Industries: Specializes in autonomous systems and AI-driven defense technologies.
	- Skydio: Focuses on autonomous drones with advanced AI capabilities.
	- AeroVironment: Develops a range of unmanned aircraft systems for military applications.

## Results

* Business Impact: Shield AI's platforms and technology have been deployed in numerous military operations providing critical, real-time intelligence on the ground. This has significantly reduced risks to U.S. Forces military men and women put in harm's way. By providing unmanned platforms that work in the harshest of tactical and active combat environments, Shield AI has become a market leader against larger Defense Contracting companies by understanding the problems faced in combat and rapidly developing technology for the nation's Warfighting elements.

* Metrics: Given the many DoD contracts and adoption by the US Department of Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), US Air Force, and US Coast Guard, they have cemented themselves categorically as a technology leader within DoD units.

* Relative Performance: Shield AI has been able to capture large government contracts in the Air Force and Coast Guard, while its competitors have developed technology for Army ground operations, such as Skydio’s $100 million contract for small reconnaissance drones. Other competitors, such as Anduril Industries, have capitalized on other tactical requirements using AI autonomous drones by providing a platform that delivers military aid packages rather than tactical reconnaissance.

## Recommendations

* Advise: I have over 22 years in the Army as a tactical enterprise engineer. I would advise Shield AI to develop UAV/UAS platforms that can take on different operational "Personas" for operational flexibility. I have deployed many times to Afghanistan and Iraq, and each deployment would present problem sets that were not seen previously. I would advise Shield AI to develop the following AI capabilities that could dynamically be assigned per operational need:

	- Counter UAV
	- Penetration Testing/Hacking
	- Reconnaissance
	- Early Warning Detection (identify weapons and military platforms)
	- Swarm Technology
	- Vampire Charging (UAV lands on a power line and self-charges)
	- Mounted Munitions (explosive ordnance)
	- Many from One: UAV that can separate into a bicopter to support increased threat response or if the vehicle is damaged
	- Multi-Fuel Platforms
	- Communication UAVs that establish a flying Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) in contested and signal jamming environments

* Benefit: This technology would allow Shield AI to expand its business vertical offering and allow their platforms to adapt to any DoD mission.

* Appropriate for Your Solution: My recommendation would allow Shield AI to provide a technology roadmap that would be modular in nature so that the company could provide advanced AI-driven UAV/UAS capabilities to every military proponent. Each branch of the military has operational specialties and operates in different environments. Developing a modular and adaptable platform would enable true Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) capabilities for niche requirements for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, and Coast Guard.
